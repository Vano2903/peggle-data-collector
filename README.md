# PEGGLE DATA COLLECTOR

## If you don't know what's peggle why are you even here xD

one day i am gonna take good care of this ;-;

## TODO / v2.0

---

things i wanna implement:

- add jwt for user authentication
- add OAuth2.0 (github OAuth seems the best option so far)
- add full search algorithm (mongob atlas offer that but means migrate to atlas)
- let user query a date like 2021-2-4 and convert it to 2021-02-04
- add a documentantation for the api
- check if a structure has default values (means not modified)
